        <h4 class="card-title">Who I am</h4>
        <p class="card-text">I am a father, husband, and kid at heart. I love to learn about new things, and I love to play video games and that is kind of what led me to this path of becoming a developer. I stumbled upon a game engine called Unity which led me to want to learn about coding, so I decided to buy a book. The first book I bought was C# for dummies :) when I wasn't learning about coding online I was reading books. I came to find that it was just what I was looking for as I learned more I started thinking about changing professions. That quickly led me to start learning about HTML, CSS, and Javascript. As I was learning much on my own I decided to take it more seriously and started looking into code bootcamps. I took the leap of faith and booked a bootcamp, Coding Dojo. It was an extensive and well worth purchase, I felt myself growing as a developer. But it did not stop there I started getting more into the coding community and found people with like minds. I found various sources to learn from including, a recent purchase of a course on Udemy from ZeroToMastery. ZeroToMastery has led me to find even more friends in the coding world, my journey has been a fun one but is far from over, and I hope I can learn more and find more friends with anyone reading this. Thanks for reading</p>
